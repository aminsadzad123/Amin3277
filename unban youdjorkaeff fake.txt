Hello, dear Instagram, after my extensive research on topics such as the reasons for closing and deactivating my various Instagram accounts, I came to the conclusion that my account was deleted in your system for reasons unrelated to your registered rules. If you take the time to check my account again, you will achieve this result, so please check my account as soon as possible and at an acceptable time and as quickly as possible and then restore it so that I can benefit from the benefits of space. I will make optimal use of your wonderful and heart-warming virtual. Many thanks
